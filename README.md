PROMPT

Your assessment for the React portion of the Bootcamp is to create a "to-do" list application using React. 
Here is what your to-do list application should do:

It should be a single page application. 
It should contain a single text-input that allows the user to enter a task. 
After submitting the task, it should add it to a list of tasks.
Each task should have two buttons on it, it should contain a green checkmark button, and a red X button. 
If you click the green checkmark button, it should mark the item as done, and grey it out on the interface. 
If you click the red X button, then it should remove the item from the list. 
If you have any questions, please let one of the instructors know!
